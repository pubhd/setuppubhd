	<h1>How to set-up a PubhD</h1>
      <div class="entry-content">
         <p>PubhD has a <a href="https://pubhd.wordpress.com/the-pubhd-format/">very simple format</a> and the <a href="https://pubhd.wordpress.com/pubhd-locations/">idea is spreading</a>. So far there have been PubhD events in Nottingham, Lincoln, Sheffield, Glasgow,&nbsp;Leicester, Brighton, Dublin and Manchester.</p>
         <p>In this post, I’m going to write about what we did to get the initial PubhD going (and how we got our speakers). It appears to have worked, and it might work for you too.</p>
         <p>By the way: we are not academics, or connected to either of the Nottingham universities. You don’t need to be an academic to start a PubhD!</p>
         <p>This is what we did:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Set up this blog:&nbsp;<a href="https://pubhd.wordpress.com/">https://pubhd.wordpress.com</a>.</li>
            <li>Added some content: the <a href="https://pubhd.wordpress.com/2013/11/11/introducing-pubhd/">Introducing PubhD</a>&nbsp;blog post, the <a href="https://pubhd.wordpress.com/about/">About</a> page, the <a href="https://pubhd.wordpress.com/contact-us/">Contact Us</a> page, the <a href="https://pubhd.wordpress.com/the-pubhd-format/">PubhD Format</a> page.</li>
            <li>Set up a Gmail account and pointed the Contact Us page at it (I have <a href="https://pubhd.wordpress.com/2013/12/11/how-to-set-up-a-contact-us-page-in-wordpress-com/">some tips</a> about how to do this so the incoming emails are nicely “filed”).</li>
            <li>Set up a Twitter account: <a href="https://twitter.com/_PubhD">_PubhD</a>.</li>
            <li>Added some content to the Twitter feed. For example, a link to the&nbsp;<a href="https://pubhd.wordpress.com/2013/11/11/introducing-pubhd/">Introducing PubhD</a>&nbsp;and a Tweet asking for speakers and directing them to the&nbsp;<a href="https://pubhd.wordpress.com/contact-us/">Contact Us</a>&nbsp;page.&nbsp;These Tweets were RTed via <a href="https://twitter.com/Notts_Skeptics">Nottingham Skeptics</a> Twitter account.</li>
            <li>Searched on Twitter for “PhD Nottingham” – and followed people that had something relevant in their bio.</li>
            <li>Searched on Twitter for “Nottingham University” – and followed people that had something relevant in their bio. We also followed lots of department accounts.</li>
            <li>Many accounts followed us back and RTed the initial Tweets.</li>
            <li>Any PhD student (i.e. potential speaker!) that followed back, received a <a href="https://twitter.com/_PubhD/status/400229333098192896">Tweet</a> encouraging them to sign-up. Many of them did. And any department that followed back was asked to pass the links around their students.</li>
            <li>We also know one or two lecturers, and one or two PhD students; we contacted them directly to spread the word.</li>
         </ol>
         <p>That’s it.</p>
         <h2>Finding more speakers</h2>
         <p>Social media was all we really used to find speakers. We didn’t have to trawl through the University People directory looking for potentially relevant contact details. Within a few days we had enough speakers for 3-4 events. Within 2-3 weeks we had enough for 16 events.</p>
         <p>However,&nbsp;since the initial recruitment period, we have emailed a few departments and PhD supervisors and found several speakers this way too. If you don’t think “social media recruitment” will work for you, you could always try to get the link to your website circulating around universities by emailing departments directly.</p>
         <h2>If&nbsp;you want to set-up your own PubhD…</h2>
         <p>If you want to set up a PubhD, please get in touch. We can provide you with the <a href="https://pubhd.wordpress.com/2013/12/11/pubhd-logos-and-banners/">banner and logo graphics in various sizes</a>, and offer lots of advice. There is also a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/PubhDOrganisers">PubhD Organisers Facebook group</a> to exchange ideas and ask questions.</p>
         <h2>Creating a website</h2>
         <p>Setting up a website is easy (and free) with, for example, <a href="http://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> and <a href="http://www.wix.com/">wix.com</a>. Example: <a href="http://pubhdleicester.wix.com/pubhd" target="_blank">http://pubhdleicester.wix.com/pubhd</a></p>
         <h2>Getting local help and finding a venue</h2>
         <p>You may want to get in touch with your local Skeptics in the Pub (SitP) group. They will be able to give you some local advice, or perhaps may even want to get involved. These groups exist all over the UK (and internationally) and they already have experience in putting on pub-based speaking events. They will probably know of a suitable venue that you could use for PubhD events. The Birmingham Skeptics website maintains a list of <a href="http://brumskeptics.blogspot.co.uk/p/sitp-groups.html">all SitP groups around the country</a>.</p>
         <h2>Facebook</h2>
         <p>We’ve also&nbsp;created a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/PubhD/">Facebook group</a>, which has proved very useful. The number of people in the&nbsp;group has gradually built up over time and we now have nearly 300 members. This&nbsp;means that when we create our FB events, we automatically get to invite nearly 300 people, which is great for getting the punters in.</p>
         <p>Note that we set the events to “Public”. This means that&nbsp;you don’t need to be in the PubhD FB group to be able to&nbsp;see the event and click “going”. Anyone on FB can indicate that they will be attending, the event can be shared and people can invite their friends.</p>
         <p>Tip: If you click “Edit group Settings” for&nbsp;your Facebook group, you can set “Group Address” to something so that you get a nice URL like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/PubhD/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/PubhD/</a> rather than something like&nbsp;<span class="skimlinks-unlinked">https://www.facebook.com/groups/1234567890</span>.</p>
         <p>Also, passing a link like this around works:&nbsp;<a href="http://fb.com/groups/PubhD">fb.com/groups/PubhD</a>.</p>
